# SYsU-Arch
CPU Components in the “SYSU_ArchLang” Project, the Compiler Components could be found [here](https://github.com/yanhuojunjun/SYSU_LANG/edit/main/README.md).

Developed a pipeline CPU capable of running the EGOS-2000 operating system. The final implementation, along with SYSU_Lang, could run a C-like language independently.

Deployed it on a BASYS3 FPGA development board and executed a sorting program written in the C-like language:
